# [Design Patterns](#design-patterns)
**Design Pattern!** It is NOT a finished design that can be directly used in source code.Design patterns are formalized best practices that can be used to solve common problems when designing systems or applications.<br>

These solutions were obtained through trial and error by numerous developers over a period of time.<br>

There are many designing patterns where can be classified in 3 categories,
1) Creational Design Pattern
2) Structural Design Pattern
3) Behavioral Design Pattern
<br>

## Why do we need Design Patterns?
As a developer, we often focus on things like how clean our code is, how little memory it uses, and how much or how little time it takes to complete a task.<br>

But the most important concern we should also consider is: "Are we able to change that code later?" What you decide today could be irrelevant tomorrow, and your code should be flexible enough so that it will not be too costly to alter.<br>

Design patterns are proven solutions that help address this challenge. They are:

 - Easily reusable (solutions like Iterator).
 - Efficient in handling large solutions elegantly.
 - Helpful in preventing the need for refactoring code frequently.
 - Capable of lowering the overall size of the codebase.
