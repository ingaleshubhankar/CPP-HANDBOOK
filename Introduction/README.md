# About this Handbook?
I’m not here to overwhelm you with a list of tools you must use. As long as you’ve got **a C++ compiler** and **an editor**, you’re **good to go**! Here, we’re diving straight into the core concepts, taking a **fresh perspective** that’s a bit different from the usual.<br>

I’m excited about this journey, and I’m sure you will be too once you explore the first few chapters. Let’s get started!
