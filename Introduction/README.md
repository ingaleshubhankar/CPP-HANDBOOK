# About this Handbook?
I’m not here to overwhelm you with a list of tools you must use. As long as you’ve got **a C++ compiler** and **an editor**, you’re **good to go**! Here, we’re diving straight into the core concepts, taking a **fresh perspective** that’s a bit different from the usual.<br>

I’m excited about this journey, and I’m sure you will be too once you explore the first few chapters. Let’s get started!

## CPP Introduction
 - C++ is an **Object-Oriented Programming** Language.<br>
 - Object-Priented Programming is **NOT** just a concept; it’s a **way of thinking.**<br>
 - We use object-oriented concepts to solve real-life problems by modeling them as objects.<br>
 - Smalltalk is considered the first object-oriented programming language.<br>
 - The concept of Classes in C++ was derived from Smalltalk, while the structural and syntactical approaches were borrowed from C.Because of this, C++ is often referred to as **"C with classes"**.<br>
 - **C++** is developed by **Bjarne Stroustrup**. Stroustrup was working on his Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Cambridge. He started the development of C++ in 1979 as an extension of the C programming language to support object-oriented programming (OOP) features.<br>
 - Initially, C++ was called "C with Classes.". Stroustrup introduced key concepts like **classes**, **objects**, and **inheritance** into the C language to enable better modularity and maintainability.<br>
 - The **first commercial release of C++** was in **1985**. Over time, it evolved to include additional features like templates, exceptions, and the Standard Template Library (STL), making it one of the most powerful and widely used programming languages today.<br>

### Important THREE Points

1. Whether C++ is **applicable** or **NOT**.
2. **Which things are required** to **solve** the problem.
3. **How can** we solve the problem statements.
