# About this Handbook?
I’m not here to overwhelm you with a list of tools you must use. As long as you’ve got **a C++ compiler** and **an editor**, you’re **good to go**! Here, we’re diving straight into the core concepts, taking a **fresh perspective** that’s a bit different from the usual.<br>

I’m excited about this journey, and I’m sure you will be too once you explore the first few chapters. Let’s get started!

## CPP Introduction
 - C++ is an Object-Oriented Programming Language.<br>
 - Object-Priented Programming is NOT just a concept; it’s a way of thinking.<br>
 - We use object-oriented concepts to solve real-life problems by modeling them as objects.<br>
 - Smalltalk is considered the first object-oriented programming language.<br>
 - The concept of Classes in C++ was derived from Smalltalk, while the structural and syntactical approaches were borrowed from C.<br>
 - Because of this, C++ is often referred to as **"C with classes"**.<br>
