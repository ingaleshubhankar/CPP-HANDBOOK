# Abstraction
Abstraction means hiding the details of how something works and showing only what is necessary. It allows users to interact with a system without needing to understand its internal workings.

In programming, abstraction can be achieved by using access modifiers like the `private` keyword to hide certain parts of the code.

There are two types of abstraction:
```
Data Abstraction: Hides the details of how data is stored and managed, showing only what is necessary.
Method Abstraction: Hides the internal logic of methods and shows only what they do
```
