# What is a Function Call?
A function call in C++ is the process of executing a function by specifying its name along with the required arguments (if any). When a function is called, the program control transfers to the function definition, executes the function body, and then returns back to the point from where it was called.<br>

A function call is an expression that invokes a function to perform a specific task. It passes control and possibly arguments to the function and may receive a return value after execution.<br>
