## [Control Flow](#control-flow)
**Control flow** in C++ refers to how the computer follows the instructions in a program, step by step. To make it easier to understand, we can look at it through three main parts: **Sequence**, **Iteration**, and **Selection**.<br>

Below are the basic categories of [control flow](https://github.com/ingaleshubhankar/CPP-HANDBOOK/blob/main/Basics%20of%20programming/ControlFlow.md#control-flow),
1. [Sequence](https://github.com/ingaleshubhankar/CPP-HANDBOOK/blob/main/Basics%20of%20programming/ControlFlow.md#1-sequence)
2. [Iteration](https://github.com/ingaleshubhankar/CPP-HANDBOOK/blob/main/Basics%20of%20programming/ControlFlow.md#2-iteration)
3. [Selection](https://github.com/ingaleshubhankar/CPP-HANDBOOK/blob/main/Basics%20of%20programming/ControlFlow.md#3-selection)

## [Time and Space Complexity](#time-and-space-complexity)
Time complexity and space complexity are two key concepts in computer science and programming that help evaluate the efficiency of algorithms. They describe how the performance of an algorithm changes with the size of the input.<br>
<br>

### [Time Complexity](#time-complexity)
Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size `n`. It is used to analyze how the runtime of an algorithm scales with larger inputs, helping us evaluate its efficiency.<br>

> **Key Points about Time Complexity**,
1. **Independent of Machine**: Time complexity focuses on the algorithm's structure and logic, not the hardware it runs on.
2. **Growth Rate**: It describes the rate at which the algorithm's runtime increases with respect to the input size.
3. **Big-O Notation**: The most common way to express time complexity, e.g., O(1),O(n), O(n^2), etc.<br>
