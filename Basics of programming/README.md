## [Control Flow](#control-flow)
**Control flow** in C++ refers to how the computer follows the instructions in a program, step by step. To make it easier to understand, we can look at it through three main parts: **Sequence**, **Iteration**, and **Selection**.<br>

Below are the basic categories of [control flow](https://github.com/ingaleshubhankar/CPP-HANDBOOK/blob/main/Basics%20of%20programming/ControlFlow.md#control-flow),
1. [Sequence](https://github.com/ingaleshubhankar/CPP-HANDBOOK/blob/main/Basics%20of%20programming/ControlFlow.md#1-sequence)
2. [Iteration](https://github.com/ingaleshubhankar/CPP-HANDBOOK/blob/main/Basics%20of%20programming/ControlFlow.md#2-iteration)
3. [Selection](https://github.com/ingaleshubhankar/CPP-HANDBOOK/blob/main/Basics%20of%20programming/ControlFlow.md#3-selection)

## [Time and Space Complexity](https://github.com/ingaleshubhankar/CPP-HANDBOOK/blob/main/Basics%20of%20programming/TimeAndSpaceComplexity.md#time-and-space-complexity)
Time complexity and Space complexity are two key concepts in computer science and programming that help evaluate the efficiency of algorithms. They describe how the performance of an algorithm changes with the size of the input.

## [Function Call](https://github.com/ingaleshubhankar/CPP-HANDBOOK/blob/main/Basics%20of%20programming/FunctionCall.md#what-is-a-function-call)
There are different types of function calls in c++. which are as follows,
 - [Call by Value](https://github.com/ingaleshubhankar/CPP-HANDBOOK/blob/main/Basics%20of%20programming/FunctionCall.md#1-call-by-value)
 - [Call by Address](https://github.com/ingaleshubhankar/CPP-HANDBOOK/blob/main/Basics%20of%20programming/FunctionCall.md#2-call-by-address)
 - [Call by Reference](https://github.com/ingaleshubhankar/CPP-HANDBOOK/blob/main/Basics%20of%20programming/FunctionCall.md#3-call-by-reference)

## [Recursion](https://github.com/ingaleshubhankar/CPP-HANDBOOK/blob/main/Basics%20of%20programming/Recursion.md#recursion-)
Recursion is powerful programming technique that can be used to solve problem, that can be expressed in terms of similer problem of smaller size. Refer the [Recursion](https://github.com/ingaleshubhankar/CPP-HANDBOOK/blob/main/Basics%20of%20programming/Recursion.md#recursion-) for more detailed explaination.
