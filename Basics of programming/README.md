## [Control Flow](#control-flow)
**Control flow** in C++ refers to how the computer follows the instructions in a program, step by step. To make it easier to understand, we can look at it through three main parts: **Sequence**, **Iteration**, and **Selection**.<br>

Below are the basic categories of [control flow](https://github.com/ingaleshubhankar/CPP-HANDBOOK/blob/main/Basics%20of%20programming/ControlFlow.md#control-flow),
1. [Sequence]()
2. [Iteration]()
3. [Selection]()
