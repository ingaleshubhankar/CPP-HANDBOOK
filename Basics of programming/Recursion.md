# Recursion ?
Recursion is powerful programming **technique that can be used to solve problem, that can be expressed in terms of similer problem of smaller size**.

Recursion is concept which can be used in any programming language which internally users user stack as data structure. We can easily convert the concept of iteration into recursion. Recursion is considered as calling the function from same function itself.

Recursion classification happen in three types Linear Recursion, Binary Recursion & N-ary Recursion.

There are **Two Categories** of recursion:
 1. Direct recursion
 2. Indirect recursion
<br>


There are **Two Types** of recursion:
1. Head Recursion
2. Tail Recursion
<br>


## Examples:-

### Tail Recursion

```
void fun()
{
    // Code
    fun();
}
```


### Head Recursion

```
void gun()
{
    gun()
    //Code
}
```

## Thing Recursive way
Every recursive solution consist of 2 ways,
1) Base case - Termination condition
2) Recursive case - Infinite condition
