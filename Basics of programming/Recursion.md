# Recursion ?
Recursion is powerful programming **technique that can be used to solve problem, that can be expressed in terms of similer problem of smaller size**.

Recursion classification
 - Linear Recursion
 - Binary Recursion
 - N-ary Recursion

Important pointers:
 - Recursion is concept which can be used in any programming language which internally users user stack as data structure.

 - We can easily convert the concept of iteration into recursion.

  - Recursion is considered as calling the function from same function itself.

There are two categories of recursion:
 a) Direct recursion
 b) Indirect recursion
