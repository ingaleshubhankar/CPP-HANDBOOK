# [Control Flow](#control-flow)
**Control flow** in C++ refers to how the computer follows the instructions in a program, step by step. To make it easier to understand, we can look at it through three main parts: **Sequence**, **Iteration**, and **Selection**.<br>

**Sequence** is the basic flow where the computer executes instructions one after another in the exact order they appear, like following a list from top to bottom.<br>

**Iteration** allows the computer to repeat a set of instructions multiple times. This is useful when we want to perform the same task repeatedly, such as looping through a list or running a process until a condition is met.<br>

**Selection** involves making decisions. The computer chooses between different paths based on certain conditions, like deciding which action to take depending on whether something is true or false.<br>

## 1. [Sequence](#1-sequence)
To get desired output if you want to apply some steps in sequential format then we have to use Sequence. In this case the flow of our sequence is important to get desired output.<br>

## 2. [Iteration](#2-iteration)
If you want to apply/perform in the repeated manner then we have to use iteration. To apply the concept of iteration we have to use loops.
Every iteration may contains Sequence, Selection or Iteration.<br>

## 3. [Selection](#3-selection)
If there are multiple possibilities to select any solution then we have to se concept of Selection. In case of selection, we have to use switch program construct or if-else-if construct.<br>
