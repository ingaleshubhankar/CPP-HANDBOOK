# [Control Flow](#control-flow)
**Control flow** in C++ refers to how the computer follows the instructions in a program, step by step. To make it easier to understand, we can look at it through three main parts: **Sequence**, **Iteration**, and **Selection**.<br>

**Sequence** is the basic flow where the computer executes instructions one after another in the exact order they appear, like following a list from top to bottom.<br>

**Iteration** allows the computer to repeat a set of instructions multiple times. This is useful when we want to perform the same task repeatedly, such as looping through a list or running a process until a condition is met.<br>

**Selection** involves making decisions. The computer chooses between different paths based on certain conditions, like deciding which action to take depending on whether something is true or false.<br>
